# AWS User Group Badge System

This guide is crafted to help you seamlessly integrate the AWS User Group Badge System into your meetups. The badge system is designed to streamline communication, enhance safety, and foster a welcoming environment for all attendees. Here's everything you need to know to make the most out of the badge system.

## Understanding Badge Types

We've developed four badge types to identify roles within our user group. Each plays a crucial role in the success of our events.

### User Group Leader

Leaders organize events, handle logistics, and ensure a welcoming and safe environment for all participants. Your badge signifies authority and approachability, making you the go-to person for questions, concerns, or if attendees feel unsafe.

### User Group Speaker

Speakers share their expertise on AWS-related topics. Encourage speakers to wear their badges prominently, making it easy for attendees to identify them for discussions about their talks.

### User Group Host

Hosts are vital for providing the space and often food for our meetups. Their badge highlights the contribution of the hosting company and opens the door for attendees interested in learning more about the host's services or expressing gratitude.

### User Group First-Timer

First-timers are attending our meetup for the first time. Their badge is an invitation for existing members to welcome them and for leaders to ensure they have a great first experience.

## Implementing the Badge System

### Printing Badges

You'll find a PDF in the ```templates``` directory designed for printing on [Avery L3415](https://www.avery-zweckform.com/produkt/runde-etiketten-l3415-10) stickers. These are ideal for handouts at event registration, allowing attendees to choose the badge that fits their role.

For digital needs or high-quality prints, the ```src``` directory contains PNG files of each badge. These are perfect for sending to print shops or including in digital presentations.

### Additional Tips

* **Briefing Session:** Before the event, have a quick session with your team to ensure everyone understands their role in leveraging the badge system to enhance the meetup experience.
* **Introduction:** Kick off your event by explaining the badge system during your welcome speech. Highlight the purpose of each badge and encourage attendees to interact accordingly.
* **Feedback Loop:** After the event, gather feedback on the badge system's effectiveness and areas for improvement. Continuous improvement will help tailor the system to best suit your group's needs.

## Feedback and Improvements

Your feedback is invaluable to the evolution of the AWS User Group Badge System.
